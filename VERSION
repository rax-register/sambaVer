Current Version: 1.3

Version 1.3 changes:
  - Removed -2x and -D options as they were obsoleted by the move away from using smbclient. This also permitted
    some variables to be removed, function definitions to simplify, and blocks of code within the main function
    to be removed as they were no longer needed.  
  - Standardized variable name format throughout.  
  - Added Dependencies section and some other details to README.md
  - Added VERSION file to include notes on version updates.
  - 231 lines of code, including comments and spacing.

Version 1.2 changes:
  - Upgrade from python 2 to python 3.
  - Updated recv_data function to check every packet as it is received for Unix Samba version instead of compiling 
    several packets and then checking.
  - Changed handling of '-s' option to always include "Samba #.#" when searching truncated version
  - 273 lines of code, including comments and spacing.

Version 1.1 changes:
  - Switch from using smbclient to pysmb's smbConnection to connect to the Samba server. This change lessens the 
    amount of network traffic generated by sambaVer.

  - Fixed an issue where some Samba server versions were reported with a trailing '-' character.
  - 279 lines of code, including comments and spacing.
